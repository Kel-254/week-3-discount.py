🧮 Discount Calculator
📖 Overview

A simple Python program that calculates the final price of an item only if the discount percentage is 20% or higher.
If the discount is less than 20%, the program ignores it and returns the original price.

✨ Features

🖊 Takes the original price and discount percentage as input.

🎯 Applies the discount only when it is ≥ 20%.

🛑 If the discount is below 20%, the original price is returned.

🔒 Handles invalid input (non-numeric values) gracefully.

⚙️ How It Works

The user is prompted to enter the original price of the item.

The user is prompted to enter the discount percentage.

Logic applied:

If discount ≥ 20% → program calculates and displays discounted price.

If discount < 20% → program displays the original price.

The program prevents crashes by handling invalid inputs.
